# Instrument-Human-Error-Analysis
This repository contains the R scripts and documentation focused on simulating a dataset with errors and cleaning processes. The errors are used to analyze and comment on the role of bias in statistical analysis. The paper discusses the impact of instrument and human errors in data collection and processing. It simulates a scenario where data is generated from a normal distribution but has certain instrumental and human errors during collection and cleaning. 

Note: Language Learning Model ChatGPT was also used while writing this paper. It was used for data cleaning and simulation. The chat with the AI bot is also attached as a reference under inputs\llm
